# Sea Ice Charting using the AutoICE  Benchmark

This repository contains scripts that can be used to train a  customized multi-task DeepLabV3 model to map sea ice parameters including Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), Stage of Development (SoD) and floe Size (FLOE) using the AutoICE challenge data. 


## Using the code
Use [`main.py`](main.py) to train the model according to a configuration file. Evaluate the model using  [`test.py`](test.py) that also requires [configuration file].
